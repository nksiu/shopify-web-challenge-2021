# Welcome
Thank you for viewing my Frontend 2021 Summer Intern Challenge for Shopify!
The demo for this challenge is avaiblable here: https://nicksiu-shopify-challenge-2021.herokuapp.com/

This application used GraphQL with React, Redux, and Apollo.

Addtional features added: 
  - Modal to show additional information about a movie
  - Nomination list persisted after refreshing or navigating away
  - Animation on load (spinner) and mounting of movie results

Features I would add in the future:
  - Mobile compatibility and more responsive UI layout
  - Sorting movie results by Year or Title
  - Modal for additional movie information to be popped up from the nomination list
